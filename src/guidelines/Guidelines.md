# NovaNews – Figma Make Design & Development Guidelines

This document defines the design, content and technical guidelines for building a prototype progressive‑web‑app (PWA) for **NovaNews** using Figma Make. It is inspired by best‑practice guidelines from earlier projects and has been adapted to fit a news platform that publishes fast‑paced, community focused stories. Use this document to brief the Figma Make AI and to guide developers as they implement the React components.

## 1. Project overview

NovaNews is a South‑African news network which consolidates community newspapers under one digital umbrella. It publishes breaking news, opinion, sport, lifestyle, recipes and more on an almost hourly basis. The app must feel modern and trustworthy while remaining lightweight and accessible. Users should be able to scan top stories, browse categories and read articles both online and offline. Navigation should be intuitive on phone, tablet and desktop.

### Primary goals

1. **Present news clearly** – prioritise readability, hierarchy and scannability. Organise content into clear sections: top stories, categories, featured articles and calls to action.
2. **Support multiple categories** – the NovaNews site lists major categories such as _Home_, _News_, _Nuus_, _Schools_, _Sport_, _Business_, _Lifestyle_, _Recipes_, _Opinion_, _E‑Editions_ and _Supplements_【253537001669534†L73-L85】. The design must accommodate these and allow new categories to be added without redesign.
3. **Encourage engagement** – use install prompts, newsletter sign‑up and "save for later" bookmarks to keep readers coming back. Provide clear prompts for enabling push notifications for breaking news.
4. **Optimise for SEO** – implement proper heading hierarchy, meta tags, structured data and descriptive image `alt` attributes. Ensure pages load quickly and meet web‑vitals targets.
5. **Accessibility first** – build using semantic HTML and ARIA attributes. Ensure colour contrast meets WCAG 2.1 AA, all interactive elements are keyboard accessible, and motion respects user preferences.

## 2. Brand identity

NovaNews should feel contemporary yet rooted in community journalism. The brand voice is straightforward and informative. Copy should be factual and concise; avoid sensationalism. The palette and typography should instil trust and make reading comfortable for long‑form articles.

### Colour palette

| Colour            | Hex       | Usage                                                                                       |
| ----------------- | --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **News Red**      | `#C32026` | Primary colour used for highlights, buttons and icons. Evokes urgency and attention.        |
| **Headline Blue** | `#003366` | Dark blue for headings, links and the navigation bar. Conveys trust and authority.          |
| **Soft Sand**     | `#F5F5F0` | Light background for content areas. Reduces eye strain and creates contrast with dark text. |
| **Mid Grey**      | `#888A8C` | Secondary text, dividers and muted elements such as metadata.                               |
| **Dark Charcoal** | `#202124` | Used for dark sections, overlay panels and dark mode backgrounds.                           |

**Notes**:

- Use the News Red sparingly for calls to action, tags and active states to avoid overwhelming the reader.
- Provide both light and dark themes. The default theme uses Soft Sand backgrounds with dark text. Dark mode inverts backgrounds and lightens text while retaining the same accent colours.

### Typography hierarchy

Use system font stacks or Google Fonts such as **Montserrat** for headings and **Open Sans** for body text. All sizes should be fluid using `clamp(min, vw, max)` to scale across devices. Weight refers to font weight; `500` is medium and `700` is bold.

| Element                 | Usage                          | Weight | Size (clamp)                    |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------ | ------ | ------------------------------- |
| **H1 – Page titles**    | Hero headlines, page titles    | 700    | `clamp(2.5rem, 7vw, 4.5rem)`    |
| **H2 – Section titles** | Section headings               | 600    | `clamp(2rem, 5vw, 3rem)`        |
| **H3 – Subsections**    | Card titles, sub headings      | 600    | `clamp(1.5rem, 4vw, 2.25rem)`   |
| **H4 – Minor headings** | Metadata headings, overlines   | 500    | `clamp(1.25rem, 3vw, 1.75rem)`  |
| **Body Large**          | Hero sublines, lead paragraphs | 400    | `clamp(1.125rem, 2vw, 1.5rem)`  |
| **Body Standard**       | Main body text                 | 400    | `clamp(1rem, 1.5vw, 1.25rem)`   |
| **Body Small**          | Captions, bylines, meta        | 400    | `clamp(0.875rem, 1.25vw, 1rem)` |

Guidelines:

- Maintain a clear hierarchy: each page uses one H1, followed by descending heading levels. Do not skip levels.
- Body text should have a line‑height of 1.5–1.6; headings 1.2–1.3. Avoid all‑caps for readability.
- For hero sections on dark images, add a semi‑transparent overlay and text shadows to maintain a contrast ratio of at least 4.5:1.

## 3. Adaptive layout & spacing

The layout must adapt seamlessly from mobile through desktop and ultra‑wide screens. Use CSS Grid and Flexbox with fluid values.

### Container system

Define several container classes to constrain content widths:

```css
/* Main container for page sections */
.container-site {
  width: clamp(320px, 85vw, 1400px);
  margin: 0 auto;
}

/* Text heavy content (articles, forms) */
.container-content {
  width: clamp(280px, 75vw, 900px);
  margin: 0 auto;
}

/* Wide blocks (image galleries, category grids) */
.container-wide {
  width: clamp(320px, 90vw, 1200px);
  margin: 0 auto;
}

/* Full‑bleed sections (heroes, banners) */
.container-full {
  width: 100vw;
  margin-left: calc(50% - 50vw);
}
```

### Fluid spacing system

```css
/* Section padding */
.padding-section {
  padding-block: clamp(3rem, 6vw, 5rem);
}

/* Horizontal padding inside containers */
.padding-horizontal {
  padding-inline: clamp(1rem, 4vw, 3rem);
}

/* Card internal padding */
.padding-card {
  padding: clamp(1rem, 2vw, 2rem);
}

/* Grid gaps */
.gap-grid-small {
  gap: clamp(0.5rem, 1.5vw, 1.5rem);
}
.gap-grid-large {
  gap: clamp(1rem, 3vw, 3rem);
}
```

**Guidelines**:

- Start with a single column on phones. Stack components vertically with generous spacing.
- At tablet widths, introduce two‑column grids for lists (e.g. service cards) and keep comfortable gutters.
- On desktop, use three or four columns for category lists; maintain consistent margins on either side.
- For the header, keep the logo on the left and the navigation on the right. On scroll, collapse the header into a sticky bar with reduced height and a subtle shadow.

## 4. Components

This section describes the key reusable components. Each component should be coded as a separate React functional component with JSDoc comments describing its purpose, props, accessibility considerations and usage examples.

### 4.1 Header

The header contains the NovaNews logo, primary navigation and a search button. In desktop view, the navigation items align horizontally: _Home_, _News_, _Business_, _Sport_, _Lifestyle_, _Opinion_, _Recipes_, _Schools_, _About_, _Contact_. On mobile, replace the navigation with a hamburger icon that opens a full‑screen overlay menu. Trap focus within the menu, provide a close button and ensure the menu slides down and fades in with a 300 ms ease transition. Use semantic `<nav>` elements and update the `aria-expanded` attribute when the mobile menu opens or closes.

### 4.2 Hero section

The hero appears at the top of the home page and category pages. It features the lead story with a large background image, category tag, headline (H1) and subheading. Include up to two call‑to‑action buttons: _Read More_ and _Sign Up for Newsletter_. On mobile, stack the text and buttons below the image; on desktop, overlay text on the image using a dark gradient.

### 4.3 Article card

Used in grids for top stories and categories. Cards include a thumbnail image (16:9), category chip, title (H3), snippet (Body Small) and meta (author, date). When clicked, the card navigates to the article page. On hover, lift the card slightly (`translateY(-0.25rem)`) and increase the shadow. Use lazy loading for images.

### 4.4 Category section

Each major category has a section on the home page showing the latest three or four articles. Section titles link to the full category page. Provide a "More" button to load additional stories via AJAX. Use CSS Grid to arrange cards; adjust columns based on screen width.

### 4.5 Newsletter call to action

Invite readers to subscribe. The block includes a short heading (H2), a supportive sentence and an email input with a submit button. Validate the email address client‑side; display success or error messages in an ARIA live region. Use brand colours for the button.

### 4.6 Footer

The footer includes three columns on desktop (stacking on mobile): (1) About NovaNews (brief description), (2) Quick links (e.g. Home, News, Lifestyle, Sport, Recipes, Opinion, Contact, Advertise) and (3) Contact & social icons. Also include legal links (Privacy Policy, Terms & Conditions) and the copyright. Use high contrast for text and ensure links are keyboard focusable.

### 4.7 Modals and interactive elements

- **Search modal** – triggered by the search icon in the header. Opens a modal with an input field and suggestions as the user types. Use the `<dialog>` element or a custom modal with `role="dialog"`. Focus should jump to the input when the modal opens; closing restores focus to the trigger button.
- **Lightbox viewer** – used for article images. Clicking an image opens a full‑screen viewer with next/previous controls. Provide keyboard navigation (arrow keys to move, Esc to close) and trap focus. Use swipes on touch devices.
- **Accordion (FAQ)** – use native `<details>` and `<summary>` for best accessibility. Only one panel should be open at a time. Provide FAQ content such as "How do I submit a story?" or "What is NovaNews?" on the Help/FAQ page.
- **Notification prompt** – a dismissible banner that appears after a reader has viewed at least two articles. Explain the benefit of enabling notifications for breaking news and provide buttons for _Allow_ or _Maybe later_.
- **Offline message** – when offline, show a page or toast indicating offline status and provide access to saved articles. Reconnect automatically when the network returns.

## 5. Pages and templates

### 5.1 Home page

- **Hero** with lead story.
- **Top stories** section showing recent posts across all categories.
- **Category sections** for News, Business, Sport, Lifestyle, Recipes, Opinion, Schools. Each uses the Category Section component.
- **Newsletter call to action**.
- **Footer**.

### 5.2 Category pages

List posts belonging to a specific category. Use infinite scroll or pagination to load more posts. Provide filters (e.g. sort by "Latest" or "Most read"). Place the category name in an H1 at the top. Use the same Article Card component; ensure SEO meta tags include the category name.

### 5.3 Article page

Display full article content. Template parts:

1. **Header** with site navigation.
2. **Hero**: large featured image, category chip and headline.
3. **Meta**: author, publication date and reading time.
4. **Body**: rich text content with headings, paragraphs, images, quotes and lists. Use proper semantic tags (`<h2>`, `<p>`, `<figure>`, `<blockquote>`). Include a share bar for social networks.
5. **Related articles**: list three articles from the same category.
6. **Comments or discussion**: optional for phase two.
7. **Footer**.

### 5.4 Static pages

Pages like _About_, _Contact_, _Policies_ and _FAQs_ use simple content templates. The Contact page includes a form (name, email, message) with validation. Display contact email and office location. The About page can feature the NovaNews mission statement and highlight the team.

## 6. React component diagram

Below is a high‑level component tree to illustrate how the site will be structured. Each component corresponds to a React functional component.

```
<App>
  ├─ <Header>
  │    ├─ <Logo />
  │    ├─ <NavMenu />
  │    ├─ <SearchButton />
  │    └─ <MobileMenu />
  ├─ <Main>
  │    ├─ <HeroSection />
  │    ├─ <TopStoriesSection />
  │    ├─ <CategorySection category="News" />
  │    ├─ <CategorySection category="Business" />
  │    ├─ <CategorySection category="Sport" />
  │    ├─ <CategorySection category="Lifestyle" />
  │    ├─ <CategorySection category="Recipes" />
  │    ├─ <CategorySection category="Opinion" />
  │    ├─ <CategorySection category="Schools" />
  │    ├─ <NewsletterCTA />
  │    └─ <RelatedArticlesSection /> (on article page)
  ├─ <ArticlePage> (route component)
  │    ├─ <ArticleHero />
  │    ├─ <ArticleMeta />
  │    ├─ <ArticleBody />
  │    ├─ <ArticleShareBar />
  │    └─ <CommentsSection /> (optional)
  ├─ <CategoryPage> (route component)
  │    ├─ <CategoryHero />
  │    └─ <ArticleGrid />
  ├─ <StaticPage> (route component)
  └─ <Footer>
       ├─ <FooterAbout />
       ├─ <FooterLinks />
       ├─ <FooterContact />
       └─ <SocialIcons />
```

This tree demonstrates nesting and modularity. The `App` component sets up routing and global providers (e.g. theme context). Each page type (home, category, article, static) is a route component that composes reusable sections. The tree can be extended to include features like bookmarking, user accounts and more.

## 7. Naming convention

Follow consistent naming to improve maintainability:

- **File names**: Use **PascalCase** for React components (e.g. `Header.tsx`, `ArticleCard.tsx`), **camelCase** for utility modules (e.g. `formatDate.ts`) and **kebab‑case** for assets (e.g. `logo-dark.svg`).
- **Component names**: Use **PascalCase** for exported React components (e.g. `HeroSection`). Use a `Props` interface suffixed with `Props` (e.g. `HeroSectionProps`).
- **Variables**: Use **camelCase** for variables and state (e.g. `currentArticle`, `isMenuOpen`). Use `UPPER_SNAKE_CASE` for constants (e.g. `API_BASE_URL`).
- **Event handlers**: Prefix with `handle` followed by the event (e.g. `handleSubmit`, `handleToggleMenu`).
- **CSS custom properties**: Use `--color-primary`, `--font-size-h1`, etc., grouped by semantic purpose rather than arbitrary values.

## 8. Interactivity and animations

- **Hover and focus states**: Provide visual feedback on links, buttons and cards. Use scaling, colour change or underline for hover; always include a visible focus ring for keyboard users (e.g. `outline: 2px solid News Red`).
- **Transitions**: Keep animations subtle (150–250 ms). Respect `prefers‑reduced‑motion` by disabling non‑essential animations when the setting is enabled.
- **Lazy loading**: Defer loading of images and sections until they are near the viewport. Use `loading="lazy"` on images and Intersection Observer for infinite scroll.
- **Forms**: Provide inline validation with clear error messages. After successful submission, replace the form with a confirmation message. Use `aria‑live` regions to announce dynamic content.
- **Offline**: Detect offline status via the Service Worker. When offline, surface a toast or bar notifying the user and provide access to previously cached articles. When connectivity returns, reload new content.

## 9. SEO and structured data

- Each page should set a unique `<title>` and `<meta name="description">` based on its content. For example, an article page's title might be "Local entrepreneur shines at Mandela Bay Arts Festival – NovaNews".
- Use `<link rel="canonical">` to avoid duplicate content issues.
- Implement **JSON‑LD** structured data for News Articles. Each article page should include a `<script type="application/ld+json">` describing the article using the `NewsArticle` schema: headline, description, datePublished, dateModified, author, image and publisher. Only mark up content that is visible to users.
- Include breadcrumb structured data using `BreadcrumbList` to help search engines understand site hierarchy.
- Ensure images include descriptive `alt` attributes (e.g. "Local entrepreneur giving speech at Mandela Bay Arts Festival") to aid accessibility and SEO.
- Submit updated `sitemap.xml` and `news‑sitemap.xml` files reflecting the PWA to Google Search Console when ready.

## 10. Sample content for the prototype

To kick‑start the Figma Make prototype, use the following sample content drawn from current NovaNews categories and sample posts. Replace it with real data during implementation.

### Hero story

**Category**: Business  
**Headline**: _"Local entrepreneur shines at Mandela Bay Arts Festival"_  
**Summary**: Young tech entrepreneur Phila Goduka is making waves in Nelson Mandela Bay with his digital solutions company. His latest showcase at the Mandela Bay Arts Festival drew crowds and investors alike.  
**Image**: Use a stock image of a smiling entrepreneur on stage.  
**CTA**: "Read full story" linking to the article page.

- Use ARIA attributes correctly and sparingly
- Test with screen readers (NVDA, JAWS, VoiceOver)

### Accessibility Testing Checklist

- [ ] Test with keyboard-only navigation
- [ ] Verify screen reader compatibility
- [ ] Check color contrast ratios with tools like WebAIM Contrast Checker
- [ ] Test with browser zoom at 200%
- [ ] Validate HTML markup
- [ ] Run automated accessibility tests (axe-core, Lighthouse)
- [ ] Test with users who have disabilities when possible

### ARIA Best Practices

- Use semantic HTML first, ARIA second
- Common ARIA attributes: `aria-label`, `aria-labelledby`, `aria-describedby`, `aria-expanded`, `aria-hidden`
- Implement landmark roles: `banner`, `navigation`, `main`, `complementary`, `contentinfo`
- Use `aria-live` regions for dynamic content updates
- Provide `role="button"` for non-button clickable elements

## 13. Performance and optimization

**Implementation Status**: ✅ **COMPLETE** - The current NovaNews PWA includes comprehensive performance optimizations with Workbox integration, caching strategies, and optimized build configuration.

**Implemented Optimizations**:

- ✅ Vite build system with code splitting and tree shaking
- ✅ Service Worker with Workbox for caching and offline support
- ✅ Image optimization via Unsplash service worker caching
- ✅ Font optimization with CSS custom properties
- ✅ Bundle optimization with vendor chunks and immutable caching
- ✅ Progressive enhancement and lazy loading foundations

### Core Performance Guidelines

- **Optimise images**: Use modern formats (WebP/AVIF) and generate multiple sizes. Limit each image to 300 kB. Preload hero images and fonts. Use a CDN for faster delivery.
- **Minify and bundle CSS/JS**: Remove unused CSS via PostCSS or PurgeCSS. Defer non‑critical JavaScript. Use code splitting in React to load route components asynchronously.
- **Service Worker**: Use Workbox to precache the app shell and runtime cache API responses. Implement a network‑first strategy for HTML and a stale‑while‑revalidate strategy for images and API calls. Provide an offline fallback page.
- **Accessibility checklist**: Ensure all images have alt text; colour contrast meets WCAG 2.2 AA; interactive elements are keyboard navigable; forms have labels and error announcements; modals and menus trap focus; and pages declare `lang="en"`.

## 14. Deployment & PWA Configuration

**Implementation Status**: ✅ **COMPLETE** - The NovaNews PWA is production-ready with comprehensive deployment configuration and PWA functionality.

### Deployment Files Ready

**PWA and Meta Tags**: ✅ **COMPLETE**

- [x] Add favicons (light and dark variants) with proper media queries
- [x] Insert meta tags for character set (`UTF-8`), viewport (`width=device-width, initial-scale=1`) and theme colour (`News Red`)
- [x] Add `manifest.json` with name, short_name, icons, start_url and display mode `standalone`

### Netlify Deployment Configuration

The project includes a complete deployment setup for Netlify:

1. **Build Configuration**: Vite build system optimized for production
2. **Headers Configuration**: Comprehensive security and caching headers in `_headers` file
3. **PWA Support**: Full service worker and manifest configuration
4. **Performance**: Optimized caching strategies and bundle splitting
5. **Functions Directory**: Serverless functions ready for backend functionality

### Netlify Functions Directory Structure

For serverless functions (API endpoints, form handlers, webhook processing), Netlify expects functions in a dedicated directory. The recommended structure follows Netlify's default convention:

```
project-root/
├── netlify/
│   └── functions/          <-- Functions Directory
│       ├── api-endpoint.js
│       ├── form-handler.js
│       └── webhook.js
├── netlify.toml
└── public/
    └── _headers
```

**Configuration in netlify.toml**:

```toml
[build]
  publish = "dist"
  command = "npm run build"

[functions]
  directory = "netlify/functions"
  # Optional: specify node bundler
  node_bundler = "esbuild"

# Environment variables can be set here
[context.production.environment]
  NODE_ENV = "production"
```

**Alternative Directory Names**:

- `functions/` (root level)
- `api/` (for API-focused projects)
- `server/` (for full-stack applications)

**Important Notes**:

- Functions directory must be specified in either netlify.toml or Netlify UI settings
- Each `.js` or `.ts` file in the functions directory becomes an API endpoint
- Functions run in Node.js environment with access to environment variables
- Useful for contact forms, newsletter subscriptions, push notification triggers, and content management

### PWA Features Implemented

- ✅ **Install Prompts**: Custom install UI with engagement-based timing
- ✅ **Offline Support**: Complete offline reading experience with saved articles
- ✅ **Push Notification Infrastructure**: Foundation ready for integration
- ✅ **App Shortcuts**: Category-based navigation shortcuts in manifest

- ✅ **Caching Strategy**: Intelligent caching with Workbox for optimal performance

## 15. Using this brief with Figma Make

When prompting Figma Make's AI to generate the site, provide a clear, concise prompt that references this Guidelines document. For example:

> "Create a responsive one‑page NovaNews news site using the specifications in **Guidelines.md**. Use the colour palette, typography scales, component structure and layout system defined in the guidelines. Include hero, top stories, category sections, newsletter call‑to‑action and a footer. Follow accessibility and SEO best practices. Populate the hero and top stories with the sample content provided."

By referencing the guidelines explicitly, the AI will align design and code decisions with our established standards. After generation, review the output against these guidelines and adjust any deviations.

## 16. Push Notification Functionality (Client Brief)

The NovaNews team has provided a separate brief outlining requirements for push notifications. Below is a summary of their key needs and how they integrate into this guidelines document.

**Implementation Status**: ✅ **INFRASTRUCTURE READY** - Push notification infrastructure has been implemented in the service worker and main application, ready for integration with Firebase Cloud Messaging or OneSignal.

### Objective

Implement a push notification system on the NovaNews website to drive traffic and boost user engagement by sending alerts about breaking news, new podcast episodes, big competitions, promotions and other relevant updates.

### Notification triggers

- **Breaking news**: send immediate notifications when a major story breaks. Editors or authorised staff should be able to trigger these manually from the admin dashboard.
- **Scheduled alerts**: send one or two notifications per day (e.g. morning and late afternoon) to prompt users to visit the site. These could be daily digests or top stories.
- **Custom alerts**: allow editors to schedule custom notifications in advance for events such as podcast drops or competitions.

### User experience

- **Opt‑in/out**: Users must be able to easily subscribe or unsubscribe from notifications. On first visit, show a non‑intrusive banner explaining the value of notifications and allow the user to opt in. Provide a settings page or toggle in the app where users can manage their preferences.
- **Device support**: Focus on mobile devices first but ensure desktop browsers can also receive notifications. Progressive Web App (PWA) technologies allow push notifications on supported platforms.

### Admin control

- **Dashboard management**: Lise and authorised staff should have a simple interface to compose, schedule, edit and send notifications. The dashboard should list upcoming scheduled notifications and allow test sends.
- **Analytics**: Provide reporting on notification delivery, open rates and click‑through rates. This will help the team refine timing and content.
- **Test notifications**: Include the ability to send a test notification to a preview device or small group before sending to all subscribers.

### Implementation considerations

- Use the **Push API** and **Notifications API** to deliver notifications. A Service Worker must handle push events and display notifications even when the site is not open.
- On the front end, request permission from users after explaining the benefits. The permission prompt should only appear after the user interacts with the site (e.g. after viewing two articles).
- Store user subscription details (e.g. push endpoint and keys) securely and associate them with their chosen topics or preferences if category‑based notifications are offered in the future.
- For scheduled notifications, consider integrating with a queue or cron system (e.g. WP‑Cron or a custom Node.js service) that triggers push messages at set times.
- Evaluate third‑party services such as Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) or OneSignal to handle cross‑browser delivery and analytics. Factor their costs into the project budget.

### Timeline and budget

- **Timeline**: Provide an estimated timeframe for design, development, testing and deployment of the push notification system. Include time for integrating admin controls and analytics.
- **Budget**: Outline any costs associated with third‑party services or plugins (e.g. notification service fees) and additional development effort. Provide options for self‑hosted versus hosted solutions.

Integrating push notifications into the NovaNews PWA will increase engagement by keeping readers informed of breaking and scheduled content. The system must respect user consent and privacy while giving editors the flexibility to manage alerts.

## 17. Typography & Design System Integration

**Implementation Status**: ✅ **COMPLETE** - The NovaNews PWA includes a comprehensive design system with fluid typography, container classes, and NovaNews brand colors integrated into Tailwind CSS.

### Brand Integration in Code

The `styles/globals.css` file implements the complete NovaNews design system:

- ✅ **Brand Colors**: All NovaNews colors (News Red, Headline Blue, Soft Sand, Mid Grey, Dark Charcoal) implemented as CSS custom properties
- ✅ **Fluid Typography**: Complete typography scale using clamp() for responsive text sizing
- ✅ **Container System**: All container classes (container-site, container-content, container-wide, container-full) implemented
- ✅ **Spacing System**: Fluid spacing utilities (padding-section, padding-card, gap-grid-small, gap-grid-large)
- ✅ **Dark Mode**: Complete dark theme implementation respecting NovaNews brand colors

### Important: Overriding Component Defaults

**⚠️ Critical for Implementation**: Many base UI components (shadcn/ui) have default styling for typography, spacing, and colors. When implementing NovaNews components, **always explicitly apply NovaNews classes to override these defaults**:

**Typography Overrides** - Always specify:

```tsx
// ❌ Don't rely on component defaults
<h1>Breaking News</h1>

// ✅ Always use NovaNews typography classes
<h1 className="text-hero-headline text-headline-blue">Breaking News</h1>
<h2 className="text-section-title text-headline-blue">Latest Stories</h2>
<h3 className="text-card-title text-headline-blue">Article Title</h3>
<p className="text-body-large text-foreground">Lead paragraph content</p>
<p className="text-body-small text-mid-grey">Meta information</p>
```

**Color Overrides** - Always specify brand colors:

```tsx
// ❌ Don't use generic classes
<Button>Read More</Button>

// ✅ Use NovaNews brand colors
<Button className="bg-news-red hover:bg-news-red/90 text-white">Read More</Button>
<Button variant="outline" className="border-headline-blue text-headline-blue hover:bg-headline-blue hover:text-white">Learn More</Button>
```

**Container and Spacing Overrides**:

```tsx
// ❌ Don't use generic containers
<div className="container">

// ✅ Use NovaNews container system
<div className="container-site padding-horizontal">
<div className="container-content">
<div className="padding-card">
<div className="gap-grid-small">
```

### Typography Classes Available

The following utility classes are available for consistent typography:

```css
.text-hero-headline      /* H1 - clamp(2.5rem, 7vw, 4.5rem) */
.text-section-title      /* H2 - clamp(2rem, 5vw, 3rem) */
.text-card-title         /* H3 - clamp(1.5rem, 4vw, 2.25rem) */
.text-body-large         /* Lead paragraphs - clamp(1.125rem, 2vw, 1.5rem) */
.text-body-small         /* Captions, meta - clamp(0.875rem, 1.25vw, 1rem) */
```

### Brand Color Utilities

NovaNews-specific color utilities are available:

```css
.text-news-red           /* News Red #C32026 */
.text-headline-blue      /* Headline Blue #003366 */
.text-mid-grey           /* Mid Grey #888A8C */
.bg-news-red             /* News Red background */
.bg-headline-blue        /* Headline Blue background */
.bg-soft-sand            /* Soft Sand background */
.border-news-red         /* News Red borders */
.border-headline-blue    /* Headline Blue borders */
```

### Component Styling Checklist

**⚠️ CRITICAL**: Base UI components (shadcn/ui, third-party libraries) often have default styles that will override NovaNews branding. Always explicitly apply NovaNews classes to ensure brand consistency.

When creating or modifying React components, always verify these styling applications:

**✅ Typography Classes Applied**:

- All headings use `.text-hero-headline`, `.text-section-title`, or `.text-card-title`
- Body text uses `.text-body-large` or default paragraph sizing
- Meta text uses `.text-body-small`

**✅ Brand Colors Applied**:

- Headings use `.text-headline-blue`
- Primary buttons use `.bg-news-red`
- Secondary text uses `.text-mid-grey`
- Borders use `.border-headline-blue` or `.border-news-red`

**✅ Container System Applied**:

- Page sections use `.container-site`
- Articles use `.container-content`
- Cards use `.padding-card`
- Grids use `.gap-grid-small` or `.gap-grid-large`

**✅ Component Defaults Overridden**:

- Check that shadcn/ui defaults are not conflicting
- Explicitly set all typography and color classes
- Test that NovaNews styling takes precedence
- Always inspect component output in browser to verify styling
- Use CSS specificity or !important when necessary for critical brand elements

### Critical Styling Override Examples

**Common Issues and Solutions**:

```tsx
// ❌ WRONG: Relying on component defaults
<Card>
  <CardHeader>
    <CardTitle>Breaking News</CardTitle>
  </CardHeader>
  <CardContent>
    <p>Article content here...</p>
  </CardContent>
</Card>

// ✅ CORRECT: Explicit NovaNews styling
<Card className="bg-card border-border">
  <CardHeader className="padding-card">
    <CardTitle className="text-card-title text-headline-blue">Breaking News</CardTitle>
  </CardHeader>
  <CardContent className="padding-card">
    <p className="text-body-large text-foreground">Article content here...</p>
  </CardContent>
</Card>
```

**Button Styling Examples**:

```tsx
// ❌ WRONG: Default button styles
<Button>Read More</Button>
<Button variant="outline">Share</Button>

// ✅ CORRECT: NovaNews brand styling
<Button className="bg-news-red hover:bg-news-red/90 text-white">Read More</Button>
<Button variant="outline" className="border-headline-blue text-headline-blue hover:bg-headline-blue hover:text-white">Share</Button>
```

**Layout and Container Examples**:

```tsx
// ❌ WRONG: Generic responsive classes
<div className="container mx-auto px-4">
  <div className="grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2 lg:grid-cols-3 gap-4">

// ✅ CORRECT: NovaNews container system
<div className="container-site padding-horizontal">
  <div className="grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2 lg:grid-cols-3 gap-grid-small">
```

### Serverless Functions Integration

The project now includes Netlify Functions for backend functionality:

**Available Functions**:

- `/.netlify/functions/push-notifications` - Push notification management and subscription handling
- `/.netlify/functions/contact-form` - Contact form processing with email validation
- `/.netlify/functions/example-api` - API endpoint template with CORS support

### App.tsx Implementation Notes

The current App.tsx implementation successfully follows NovaNews styling guidelines:

**✅ Properly Implemented Styling**:

- Uses `text-section-title text-headline-blue` for main headings
- Applies `text-card-title text-headline-blue` for article titles
- Implements `text-body-large text-mid-grey` for descriptive text
- Uses `container-site` for responsive page layout
- Applies `padding-card` for consistent card spacing
- Implements `gap-grid-small` for grid layouts
- Uses brand colors: `bg-news-red`, `border-headline-blue`, `text-news-red`

**✅ Component Override Examples**:

```tsx
// Breaking news banner with NovaNews styling
<Card className="mb-6 bg-news-red/10 border-news-red/20">
  <CardContent className="padding-card">

// Category headers with proper typography
<h1 className="text-section-title text-headline-blue mb-2 capitalize">

// Buttons with explicit brand styling
<Button className="border-headline-blue text-headline-blue hover:bg-headline-blue hover:text-white">
```

**✅ Accessibility Implementation**:

- Skip links with proper focus management
- Semantic HTML structure with `<main>`, `<nav>`, proper headings
- ARIA attributes for dynamic content
- Screen reader announcements via toast notifications
- Keyboard navigation support throughout

**Integration with Frontend**:

```tsx
// Example: Contact form submission
const handleSubmit = async (formData) => {
  try {
    const response = await fetch(
      "/.netlify/functions/contact-form",
      {
        method: "POST",
        headers: { "Content-Type": "application/json" },
        body: JSON.stringify(formData),
      },
    );
    const result = await response.json();
    // Handle success/error
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("Form submission error:", error);
  }
};
```

## 19. Push Notification Brief (Formatted for Google Docs)

### Objective

Implement a push‑notification system on the **NovaNews** site to increase traffic and user engagement by alerting subscribers about important updates.

### Required Functionality

1. **Notification types**

   - **Breaking news:** immediate alerts for urgent stories.
   - **Daily alerts:** scheduled notifications once or twice per day (morning and late afternoon) encouraging users to visit the site.
   - **Custom alerts:** manually triggered messages for special events, competitions, promotions or podcast releases.

2. **User controls**

   - **Opt‑in/out:** users must be able to easily enable or disable notifications at any time.
   - **Scheduling:** if possible, allow editors to schedule notifications in advance.

3. **Target devices**

   - The initial scope focuses on **mobile devices** (push notifications sent to smartphones and tablets).

4. **Admin interface**

   - **Editorial control:** Lise and Ash need the ability to manage and send notifications from their side.
   - **Scheduling & editing:** admins should be able to schedule, edit and delete upcoming notifications.
   - **Testing:** provide a way to send test notifications before they go live.
   - **Analytics:** access to reporting on open/click rates for each notification.

5. **Project considerations**
   - **Timeline:** an estimated timeline for implementation should be provided.
   - **Budget:** identify any costs associated with third‑party services or plugins plus additional development work.

## 20. Responses to the NovaNews Web App Questions (Based on the Push Notification Brief)

**1. Content priorities**

The push brief does **not** specify which categories or content types should appear on the home screen or whether special content (videos, galleries, live blogs) requires unique presentation. These topics would need to be determined separately by the editorial team.

**2. Push notifications**

- **Triggers:** Notifications should be sent for breaking news, daily alerts (morning and late afternoon), and any custom events such as competitions, promotions or podcasts.
- **User opt‑in/out:** Users must be able to opt in or out of notifications easily. The brief does not specify category‑based preferences, but opt‑in/out is mandatory.
- **Frequency:** A maximum of one or two daily alerts is suggested, plus breaking news and manually triggered messages. Over‑notifying should be avoided to reduce uninstalls.

**3. Personalisation and offline content**

The push brief only addresses notifications; it does not cover personalising the feed, offline caching of articles or bookmarking features. Decisions on these items should come from a broader product strategy.

**4. User account and login**

The brief does not mention any account‑based features such as subscriptions, paywalls or commenting. Push notifications would likely be available without requiring a login. Any account functionality must be defined separately.

**5. Advertising and sponsorship**

The brief does not cover advertising formats or placement. Ads are outside the scope of the push notification specification and would need a separate plan.

**6. Analytics and metrics**

The only analytics mentioned are **notification open and click rates**. The team should ensure the admin dashboard provides these metrics. Other analytics (page views, category popularity, installation rates) are not addressed in the push brief.

**7. Platform requirements**

The brief targets mobile devices specifically. It does not state whether the PWA will be packaged for app stores or integrated with Windows/macOS features. Those requirements must be clarified separately.

**8. Design considerations**

Design aspects such as themes, dark mode, accessibility and alignment with the existing NovaNews aesthetic are not covered in the push brief and will need to be defined during the broader design process.
